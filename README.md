## Description 🤨
In these exercises, I have practiced the following points:
Setting up an Express server, install dependences also as devDependencies.
Practicing CRUD operations with endpoints:

Create => Post
Read => Get
Update => Put
Delete => Delete

### Technologies used 👩‍💻
* Node.js
* Exress JS

## TODO lists ✔

* Create a file named ej3.js
* Set up an Express server
* When calling localhost:3000/products, the following JSON should be displayed:
 {
 description: 'Products',
    items: [
        { id: 1, name: 'Harry Potter Mug' , price: 300}, 
        { id: 2, name: 'FIFA 22 PS5' , price: 1000},
        { id: 3, name: 'Goku Super Saiyan Figure' , price: 100},
        { id: 4, name: 'Zelda Breath of the Wild' , price: 200},
        { id: 5, name: 'Valorant Skin' , price: 120},

    ]
}
* Create an endpoint to create a new product
